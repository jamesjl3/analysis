1) The macro Fun4All_JetSpectrum.C is used to go through the data DST_JET & DST_JETCALO to generate TTree for further jet spectrum analysis.
   It needs an input dst list. The golden run list is in https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/analysis/blob/c5ad8fada7f94e583a8e9761f897b98d1528af86/runListGeneration/Run2024pp/Full_ppGoldenRunList_Version2.list
   And a TTree maker module is also needed to get the information of z-vertex, jet_info (energy, ET, pT, eta, phi, and energy in each calorimeter layer), and trigger info. An example module caloTreeGen is in src/ for reference.

2) The macro Fun4All_JetSpectrumSim.C is used to go through the simulation data set to generate TTree for further jet specturm analysis.
   The z-vertex, jet_info (energy, ET, pT, eta, phi, and energy in each calorimeter layer), and truth jet info (energy, ET, pT, eta, phi) is needed for simulation data set.

3) After getting the TTree, the macro in offline/ will help to get the jet spectrum.
